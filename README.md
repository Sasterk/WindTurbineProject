# project 1
Description:
This is the first class project for our data analytics bootcamp. The contributors are Steven Sterkenburg, Luke Schumaker, Justin Moreland and Kevin Ladisheff. For this project, we are looking into Wind Turbines in the United States. Our dataset came from The US Wind Turbine Database, https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/. 

Code:
All code was authored by Steven, Luke, Justin and Kevin. The majority of our code came from concepts we discussed in class, as well as homework challenges. There were some challenging sections, which required us to look up syntax on the internet. We also need to credit the US Wind Turbine Database, the documentation on their API is well written and we found the examples there very useful.
